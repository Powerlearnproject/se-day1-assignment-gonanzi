Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
SE is the process of planning, designing, developing, testing deploying and maintaining/updating a software.
It heps to develop good quality sotware/product that is accepted by clients
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
budgeting, team creating and codding

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning, development, Testing, Deployment, maintence and updating

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Whatfall requires that no nwe step will be initiated before the previous is completed while in Agile every step is completed and tested but you vcan go to next tep of development before finishing the previous other but also with agile you can go back and forth

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Softwre developer designs, developes, deploys and maintains the software, tests the quality of the software, while the project manager plans the entire development of the software project to completion. The PM asigns roles to the teams depending on their roles and professions.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
